# blender-vse-addon

This repo has an add-on for use with the Blender Video Sequence
Editor.  It is a work in progress:

Current features:

* Render current frame to a file
* Add a "parry timer" freeze frame and text annotation
* Add a boss attempt number
* "Ripple" delete selected strips and move rightward strips to close the gap

To use this, use F3, type "smcpeak", then choose one of the operators.
A better UI is TODO.
